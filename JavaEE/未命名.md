# 1 Depenedency Injection 


==Dependency Injection is a design pattern where object creation and using the object are separated from each
other.==
An object receives all other objects it depends on as parameter, so the object itself does not need to “know”
how to construct the object it depends on. Instead, the objects are provided by an Injector.
